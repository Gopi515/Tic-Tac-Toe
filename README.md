A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an intuitive user interface. The game allows
two players to compete by taking turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3
grid. It includes logic to determine the winner or identify a draw, and provides
a clear visual indication of the game's outcome. The project demonstrates
fundamental game development principles, including user input handling,
game state management, and interface design.
